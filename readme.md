##  Features

###  Upload Videos
Upload your `.mp4` files to the platform and have them automatically queued for processing.

###  Transcription (Whisper by OpenAI)
Once uploaded, the app extracts and transcribes audio using Whisper models.

###  Translation (MarianMT)
The transcribed text is then translated from the source language to English (or other languages if extended), using the MarianMT transformer models.

###  Translated Audio Generation
The translated transcript is converted to speech using TTS models (optionally).

###  Translated Video Overlay
The generated translated audio can be embedded into the original video, creating a dubbed version of the original content.

###  Download Options

- Download translated audio (MP3)
- Download translated video (MP4)

- Delete videos and their associated assets easily.
